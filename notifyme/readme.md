A "Notify Me" functionality is typically used in e-commerce, stock tracking, or any system where users want to be notified when an event occurs (e.g., an item is back in stock, a price drops, or a service becomes available).

Here's how we can approach this:

1. High-Level Design (HLD)
Actors:
User: Requests notifications.
System: Manages notification subscriptions and triggers.
Notification Service: Sends out notifications (Email, SMS, Push).
Components:
Frontend/UI: Allows users to subscribe.
Backend Service: Handles user requests and manages notifications.
Database: Stores subscriptions and events.
Message Queue: Ensures reliable event processing.
Notification Service: Sends notifications via different channels.
Flow:
User subscribes to a notification.
System stores the subscription.
When an event occurs, a message is sent to a queue.
Notification Service picks it up and notifies the user.
2. Low-Level Design (LLD)
Database Schema:
User: id, name, email, phone, preferences
Subscription: id, user_id, event_type, status
Event: id, event_type, reference_id, created_at
Technology Stack:
Java (Spring Boot, Vert.x) for backend
MySQL/PostgreSQL for structured data
Redis/Kafka for event queuing
RabbitMQ for reliable message processing
Firebase/Twilio/SES for notifications
Scalability Considerations:
Use Kafka or RabbitMQ for distributed event processing.
Cache recent events with Redis to reduce DB load.
Horizontally scale services using Kubernetes.
Implement rate limiting to prevent spamming users.
